	1.	Backend API validates the request and builds the transaction intent, including function, parameters, and target contract.
	2.	RelayerSigner prepares the raw transaction with values such as to, value, data, gas, nonce, and chainId.
	3.	RelayerSigner calculates the transaction digest (hash to be signed, following EIP-155 for Ethereum).
	4.	RelayerSigner sends the digest to AWS KMS using the KMS SDK.
	5.	AWS KMS signs the digest internally with the private key in the HSM and returns the signature.
	6.	RelayerSigner attaches the signature to the raw transaction, serializes it using RLP encoding, and broadcasts it to the blockchain node via JSON-RPC.
