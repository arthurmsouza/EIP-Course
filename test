Hi [Name/Team],

In addition, please clarify a few points regarding the Validium setup and ensure these are properly included in our documentation:
	1.	RBAC
	We need to specify at which layer the access control definition should occur.
	At the application/API Gateway level?
	At the smart contract level?
	Or via an off-chain component that represents this functionality?
	2.	Validium Operator
	Please clarify which component should represent the Validium operator.
	3.	Enterprise Trusted Bridge
	How is privacy ensured when bridging to L2 with Validium?
	Once transactions are bridged, how is privacy maintained?
	Is it possible to enforce RBAC policies for the bridge node?
	4.	Infrastructure
	The cloud infrastructure documentation should be updated with the Validium perspective, including nodes and off-chain components.
