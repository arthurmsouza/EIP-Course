Service Layer

Orchestrates business use cases.

Coordinates between domain entities, repositories, and external systems (e.g., Paladin Relayer).

DDD convention: these are Application Services (when they orchestrate) or Domain Services (when they encapsulate domain logic).

DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

Represent request/response models for APIs.

Separate external API contract from domain entities.

DDD convention: DTOs belong to the Application Layer.

DAO/Repository Layer

Encapsulates persistence logic.

Interfaces are in the Domain Layer, implementations in the Infrastructure Layer.

DDD convention: Repository is a core building block.

Entities

Represent domain objects (e.g., Token, Account, Balance).

Contain attributes and business rules.

DDD convention: live in the Domain Layer.
