The DevOps CI/CD pipeline integrates source code management, build automation, and deployment into a streamlined process that ensures rapid and reliable delivery of application updates. Source code is managed in public repositories (GitHub, Docker Hub), where commits trigger the AWS Code and AWS Pipeline services to orchestrate automated builds, tests, and deployments. Application artifacts and container images are stored securely in the AWS Container Registry and S3 Artifact Store, ensuring version control and traceability. Once validated, updated services are deployed into the Swift API Sandbox environment on Google Cloud Platform, where the Application API and OAuth Server are hosted. This setup enables a fully automated, secure, and auditable workflow from code commit to production deployment, supporting agility while maintaining compliance and reliability.
