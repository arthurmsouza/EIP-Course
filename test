NotoBridgeContract (Escrow) is deployed on Linea L2 and is used to lock ERC20/3643 public tokens when bridging into Paladin. Upon receiving a valid Proof of Burn confirmation from the Paladin Relayer, it unlocks the equivalent tokens back into the public domain.

TokenBridge Contract and Message Contract are responsible for handling proof submission and synchronizing token states between Ethereum L1 and Linea L2. These contracts are provided and maintained by ConsenSys.
