Hi Ricardo, Florian,

Just following up on this week’s discussions — we have identified some pending items that were not fully covered in the current design solution. Since the requirements and scope remain the same as previously shared, I’ll summarize the key points below:

⸻

Privacy Layer – Design Solution L2
	•	Swap Smart Contract with custom privacy: all requirement details were already shared via email (Privacy Solution Challenge, Solution & Next Steps). This involves Pente, where the privacy group provides a solid design solution with all components involved and an end-to-end flow.
	•	The Paladin SDK is not compatible with Java implementations. Our expectation is that you provide a solution for this gap. At the moment, this is blocking the development team, as it is still unclear which design solution to adopt.

Enterprise Bridge Privacy Solution
	•	Provide all Smart Contract Bridges and off-chain components involved in this flow.
	•	Deliver a sequence diagram representing the two-way interaction between the Enterprise Network and the Paladin Node (Noto).
	•	Set up a Paladin node for the Bridge.
