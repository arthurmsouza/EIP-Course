Direct Relayer Integration)

The Paladin Relayer is the privacy solution that enables secure interoperability between the Enterprise network and the Swift SLE ecosystem. Instead of relying on external bridge components, the Enterprise interacts directly with the Paladin Relayer API using the Paladin SDK over a secure, authenticated network channel.

As the privacy layer, the Paladin Relayer enforces strict admission controls (mTLS, IP allow-listing, JWT/HMAC) and ensures that every request complies with enterprise and regulatory policies. Once validated, the Relayer delegates execution to the Paladin Notary and Privacy Group runtime, where Noto tokens and Hooks smart contracts enforce confidentiality, compliance, and business logic.

This design provides enterprises with a direct, privacy-preserving integration path:
	•	Deposit flows allow enterprises to request minting of Noto tokens inside a private Paladin domain.
	•	Withdrawal flows enable enterprises to burn Noto tokens privately and reconcile settlement back into their enterprise ledgers.

By centralizing privacy and compliance functions in the Paladin Relayer, the solution ensures that sensitive operations remain protected, while interoperability with the Swift SLE environment is maintained through a controlled and secure channel.
