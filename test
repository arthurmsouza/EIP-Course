Service Layer
Coordinates interactions between domain entities, repositories, and external systems. Invoked by controllers, it executes domain logic and communicates with DAOs for data persistence.

A DTO (Data Transfer Object) is a simple data container used to transfer information between layers of the application or across system boundaries (e.g., between the Backend API and the frontend, or between Backend and Relayer).
	•	Purpose:
	•	Decouple external API contracts from internal domain models.
